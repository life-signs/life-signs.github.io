					<p>Currently Ed has no presence on the internet. His old domain at life-signs.net has expired and his old website has been deleted. The current arrangement works but it is unorganized and difficult to be efficient. Because Ed has limited access to design tools, he and Doug meet at the Lamar office. When it comes to the evangelical billboard industry, Ed's approach is unique and fresh. Competition has an affinity for bold and jarring messages meant to grab drivers attention. All this does is make people confused about Christianity, or angry at the condecending tone of the billboard. Helpful tip for the competition, telling people they're going to hell is not a great marketing strategy and will only surve to make people angry.</p>
					<p>Below are images concerning competition </p>

				<p>Christian billboards have a negative stigma and it is derived from poorly executed campaigns. A few campaigns have good branding such as "For Truth." They effectively use consistency and simple,readible, and non-threatening messages. Their phone number in large type clearly reads as a call to action for the audience to "call the number to gain access to the truth." However, when a one looks further into the campaign and the people driving it, you are met with false christian doctrine or other religious controversy. </p>
				<p>One of the best innovations in the outdoor advertising space are the increase in digital billboards. Digital boards flip through a scheduled list of images to let companies multiply their running ads by multitudes as high as 20. These images are sent to the board from the office without the need for a crew to go to the location and intall a new canvas. The rotating schedule also increases retention rate of the audience when stationary at traffic stops. </p>
				<p>All this in mind, who is the target audience and what goals would the website have? </p>
