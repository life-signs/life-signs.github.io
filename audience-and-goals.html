					</header>
					<div class="image fit">
						<p>Because of how broad Life-Signs' audience is it can be difficult to target highly detailed segments. However, five main audiences can be divided with specific under each audience. In order of highest importance, Non-Christians, Christians, Volunteers, Publishers, and Owners and Staff. Under these segments, more specific goups follow. Examples being Non-Christians who are adults, or Christians who are curious about the Life-Signs organization. The publisher and owner/staff audience are not as wide as the other three, yet are still important enough to include.</p>

						<p>When it comes to website goals, the site exists to expand the current reach of the present evangelical campaign, act as a platform for monetary donations, and increase awareness of Life-Signs. The website would be sucessful if it gained site visitors, had a high retention rate, increased the phone call volume, and generated donations. Metrics are measurement that tell developers basic infomation. They can be used to calculate site-sucess. The metrics this site will use are visitors via links or organic searches, ammount of funds raised, and phone call metrics. The phone call metrics would be number of calls, number of percieved conversions, interest in percent of callers, and support in percent of callers. It's impact to the Life-Signs cause would be the number of people converted to Christianity, amount in donations generated, and spread the idea of a website for a Christian billboard campaign. The site format follows one of research: inform the visitor, support/expand the cause, and direct the visitor. Reasons for the audience to visit include seeing billboards/organic interest and content, a desire to support Life-Signs, and research Life-Signs. Possible areas the audience would visit would be home, work, in public spaces, alone, and with friends. The passenger may visit the website whle the on the road, and the driver may call while on the road.</p>

						<h1>Client Interviews</h1>
						<p class="info">What do they think? How do users feel?</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Ed Harper</h2>
					<p>Over the summer I interviewed Ed Harper about a website for his billboard campaign. He had been commissioning billboards for the past 20 years with Lamar Outdoor Advertising. Before his partnership, he had been handing out pamphlets at sports events when he noticed a plane flying with a banner behind it advertising. IT hit him that advertising outdoors would be a great way to evangelize. He began his search for a way to advertise outside. He went from company to company with no avail until he met with Douglas Keech of Lamar Outdoor Advertising. Lamar offers a PSA package at a lower rate that was perfect for Ed’s need. They’ve been working together ever since. </p>
					<p>The major concerns Ed brought up was a way for others to donate. He had been funding all the billboards in the past and a major way to grow the message was through donations from those interested. He used to have a website with basic information, but it has since expired. A website would serve as a platform for Ed to be gifted donations for future billboards, and to inform people of the message of the boards they have seen on the highways.</p>
					<h2>Doug Keech</h2>
					<p>Doug and Ed have been working with Life-Signs for years. Ed would come into Doug’s office with a concept and Doug would help put together a billboard. Ever since the instillation of digital billboards, Ed has been able to purchase many more slots at discounted rates. But this also increases the number of designs he may need. As Doug’s publisher, he suggested that Ed would do well with a website to seem like a legitimate campaign. In the future, Ed may need to present his idea in fundraising campaigns, and it would be more believable if a website gave a record of past designs and information about the campaign. A special hidden page would also be useful for Ed to use as a presentation point in meetings. </p>
					<p>Their interviews reinforced the ideas currently in my thought process. Very few people do what Ed does and because of this, Ed’s campaign is unique and will act as a trailblazer. Key ideas brought up in the interviews were the donate feature, presentation page, and past billboard gallery. </p>
