					<h2>Ed Harper</h2>
					<p>Over the summer I interviewed Ed Harper about a website for his billboard campaign. He had been commissioning billboards for the past 20 years with Lamar Outdoor Advertising. Before his partnership, he had been handing out pamphlets at sports events when he noticed a plane flying with a banner behind it advertising. IT hit him that advertising outdoors would be a great way to evangelize. He began his search for a way to advertise outside. He went from company to company with no avail until he met with Douglas Keech of Lamar Outdoor Advertising. Lamar offers a PSA package at a lower rate that was perfect for Ed’s need. They’ve been working together ever since. </p>
					<p>The major concerns Ed brought up was a way for others to donate. He had been funding all the billboards in the past and a major way to grow the message was through donations from those interested. He used to have a website with basic information, but it has since expired. A website would serve as a platform for Ed to be gifted donations for future billboards, and to inform people of the message of the boards they have seen on the highways.</p>
					<h2>Doug Keech</h2>
					<p>Doug and Ed have been working with Life-Signs for years. Ed would come into Doug’s office with a concept and Doug would help put together a billboard. Ever since the instillation of digital billboards, Ed has been able to purchase many more slots at discounted rates. But this also increases the number of designs he may need. As Doug’s publisher, he suggested that Ed would do well with a website to seem like a legitimate campaign. In the future, Ed may need to present his idea in fundraising campaigns, and it would be more believable if a website gave a record of past designs and information about the campaign. A special hidden page would also be useful for Ed to use as a presentation point in meetings. </p>
					<p>Their interviews reinforced the ideas currently in my thought process. Very few people do what Ed does and because of this, Ed’s campaign is unique and will act as a trailblazer. Key ideas brought up in the interviews were the donate feature, presentation page, and past billboard gallery. </p>
