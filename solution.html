				<p>The final product is this website!
					<p>Because of the timescale for this assignemnt, the actual construction of a webpage for our non-profit is not feasible. However, this process site and style tile below act to show the experience a visitor might have on Life-Signs website.
						<p> Style tiles are layouts with key elements to give a feeling of a website without making symantic decisons such as layout and button placement. Textures, headers, buttons, colors, and other elements are implemented to show how they can be used in a site wide mannor. Below is a style tile showing how Life-Signs might look.
							<p>A major aspect of a style tile, is the call to action. The call to action is the one or two things actions being asked of the website visitor. For Life-Signs, there are two. Based on the interviews and research, it the first call to action is for visitors to learn more about the Life-Signs or Christianity. The second call to action is for a visitor to support the organization. Two buttons with differing levels of heirarchal weight present these calls to action.
